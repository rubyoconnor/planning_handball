    <h2 class="mt-3">Brief</h2>
    <h4 class="mt-3">I have been asked to develop a website for Handball New Zealand.
        Jerry the President of NZ Handball, has approached me, and we have discussed the key aims for the website.
        The aims have been listed out in order of priority and this means that I can complete and have feedback on tasks at regular intervals.
        Before starting the website I completed some UX studies

        - Looking at the types of users who will be accessing the site and the kind of design and experiences that they expect when they are online
        - Doing some competition analysis to get a sense of the design style and features of websites that perform similar functions.
        - Completing a basic plan for the site, with the understanding that this most likely will evolve over the project</h4>

    <h4>I thought that a black and white theme would be great for the site as it New Zealands 'colours'.
    I wanted to implement this with the background being ombre. Above are three different mockup options that
    I made to get the general idea of how the homepage should look. </h4>

    <h4>This was another option for the banner on the homepage because the black and white theme
    did lack colour and was looking quite bland. But this design is bold.</h4>

    <h4>After discussing with the Jerry we decided that the design of the banner above was the best suit
    for the website. As the photo as the banner was going to be too bold for the website. This
    is because the purpose of the website is to inform people so it needs to be as clear as
    possible. Having a big image like this as the banner could be overwhelming for the user
    and make their experience worse. </h4>

    <img class="w-50" src="assets/images/option_4.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
    <h4>Above shows another trial for the homepage. This is because although that banner was the design that was
        decided on, I continued to make more versions of the homepage following this design. I added the photo
    to try to give the page more colour but I didn't really like the placement of it. So removed it again. </h4>

        <img class="w-50" src="assets/images/homepage-final-2.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
    <h4>Above is the final design of the homepage. I changed the events from horizontal to vertical so that the
    user could see what else is on the page, in order to hopefully make them interested. I added the photos and the lines
    next to the subtitles in order to add a bit of colour to the page. </h4>

    on the news page yet. This is something that I will add in future sprints. </h4>

    <h4>This the banner that appears to let the user know that they have logged in. The photo on the left is the first
    trial of this banner. It would stay there until the user logged out. This banner does it's job as it is very obvious and
    clear but overtakees the page. So on the right, is the newest version of the "you have logged in" banner idea. This still
    is very obvious and lets the user know that they have logged in but more subtle and it is also able to be dismissed. </h4>
